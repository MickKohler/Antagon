# Antagon
### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Mick Kohler
**I am a programming starter and student at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.**
This little program aims to create a modified version of "Langton's Ant" (otherwise it would be boring). 
For the original "Langton's Ant" game, see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant). 
The details of my version, Antagon, can be seen [here](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17414790/SS24assignment3_v1.1.pdf). Additionally, I added a help-functionality, that is executed by typing "help" and explains the other commands.
